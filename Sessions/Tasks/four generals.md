there should be four generals as we're slaughtering these fine folk, and unfortunately they haven't really spoken much to us. but [[Tall]] can speak giant, and as such, can be extremely useful both for finding who the four generals are, as well as figuring out [[who is supplying them]] by reading giant as well.

| General |                                                                                                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Pretty sure the first general was the larger giant that showed up after the two on [[11.28.2021]]           |
| 2       | The second general was [[General Snurre]] found on [[12.3.2021]]. Evidenced by [[General Snurre's Journal]] |
| 3       |                                                                                                             |
| 4       |                                                                                                             |
