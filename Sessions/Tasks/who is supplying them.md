dont forget about this, we've cleared the area halfway out. absolutely need to search down the building to see if we can find anything.

[[ideas]]:
- The bedroom that we couldn't seem to open
    - [[my lockpick]] didn't work, can always try again
    - [[magic]] on the door was [[dispelled]], didn't learn type
    - Trying to [[blow up]] the lock didn't work, can always make a bigger [[explosion]]
- Search the [[corpses]] of the [[giants]] for clues
