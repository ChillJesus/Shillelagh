[[General Snurre's Journal]]
Large tome, written in a language we don't understand, [[Tall]] can read it as she can read [[giant]]
Name on it: [[General Snurre]]
inside is barely legible writing:                                                                  
_Trove behind kings throne_
_The secret way containing blood ooze_
_Beware of traps, that new tinkerers and warlocks have been placing_
_New recruits in production soon_
he was obviously one of the [[four generals]] and i believe the text is a way to find [[who is supplying them]]
what is:
-   [[blood ooze]]
-   [[producing new recruits]]
-   [[new warlocks and tinkerers]]
i believe more answers can be found in the [[giants bedroom]]
